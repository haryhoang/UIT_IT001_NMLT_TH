> **"Algorithms are the heart of Computer Science."**

##  Introduction
Welcome to my repository for **IT001 - Introduction to Programming*! 
I am **Harry Hoan)**, a UIter in **Computer Engineering** at the **University of Information Technology (UIT)**.

This repository documents my solutions to practical lab exercises, focusing on building a strong foundation in **C++ syntax, algorithmic logic, and problem-solving techniques**.

##  Repository Structure

The exercises are organized by topics, covering essential programming concepts:

| Folder | Topic | Key Concepts & Learnings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Array 1D/`** | 🔢 **One-Dimensional Arrays** | Basic array manipulation, Linear Search, Sorting algorithms (Interchange Sort), reversing arrays. |
| **`Array 2D/`** | 🧊 **Two-Dimensional Arrays** | **Matrix operations** (Addition, Multiplication), finding Saddle Points, traversing rows/columns. 
| **`String/`** | 🔡 **String Processing** | ASCII manipulation, string comparison, normalization, finding substrings. |
| **`Recursion/`** | 🔄 **Recursion (Đệ quy)** | Understanding base cases & recursive steps. Solving problems like Fibonacci, Factorials, and Summation. |
| **`Struct/`** | 📦 **Structs (Data Types)** |  Creating custom data types for complex object management. |

##  Coding Standards

To ensure code quality and readability, I follow these principles:
*   **Meaningful Naming:** Variables and functions are named in English (e.g., `findMax`, `sortArray`).
*   **Comments:** Key logic steps are explained via comments (Vietnamese to easily understand)
*   **Modularity:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller functions.

##  Goals

This repository is not just for homework; it serves as my preparation for:
*   **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** in the next semester.
*   **Embedded Programming** (Optimizing C++ for Hardware).
*   **Academic Competitions** (Olympic Informatics).
